Name
====

bvitview -- Inspect BVIT lightcurves generated using bvitphot.

Usage
=====

bvitview datafiles (clobber) (logfile) (verbose) (debug)

Parameters
==========


*datafiles*
    String. List of bvitphot generated lightcurves. These may be plain ascii or fits tables.

*clobber*
    Hidden Boolean. If clobber=y the tool is permitted to overwrite an existing
    file with name outfile.

*logfile*
    String. Name of an ascii file for storing log and error messages
    from the tool. The file may be new, or messages can also be appended to a
    pre-existing file.

*verbose*
    Boolean. If verbose=n, log messages will be suppressed.

*debug*
    Boolean. If debug=y, will give more ellaborate debug information when an error occurs use this option to gather information when reporting a bug.

Description
===========


This tool can be used to quickly inspect a lightcurve generated by bvitphot.
There is an option to display any or all of the following data: normalized target, normalized target background, normalized comparison, normalized comparison background, and flux ratio

Examples
========

1. To inspect a lightcurve stored as plain ASCII enter::

    --> bvitview datafiles="lightcurve.dat" clobber=y logfile=salt.log verbose=y debug=n

2. To inspect a lightcurve stored as a binary FITS table enter::

    --> bvitview datafiles="lightcurve.fits" clobber=y logfile=salt.log verbose=y debug=n

2. To inspect a series of lightcurves, stored in arbitrary format, listed in ``files.lst`` enter::

    --> bvitview datafiles="@files.lst" clobber=y logfile=salt.log verbose=y debug=n

Time and disk requirements
==========================

Should load in maximum of 5 seconds on any recent machine.
Main time consumption is in loading the datafiles.


Bugs and limitations
====================

Simple tool for quick and easy inspected.
FFT mode not well tested yet, please help here.
