Welcome to PySALT's documentation!
==================================

The PySALT user package is the primary reduction and analysis software tools for the `SALT <http://www.salt.ac.za/home/>`_ telescope.
Currently, these tools include basic data reductions for  RSS and SALTICAM in both imaging, spectroscopic, and slot modes.
Basic analysis software for slot mode data is also provided.  These tools are primarily written in python/PyRAF with some additional IRAF code. 

These pages are currently in the processes of being updated as of July 2014.   Please report any outdate pages that you find.
